# For this project, I downloaded Top 50 Most Followed Instagram Accounts data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert the Instagram data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Instagramdata 
(
rank integer primary key,
username varchar NOT NULL,
owner varchar NOT NULL,
followers_in_millions integer NOT NULL,
profession_activity varchar NOT NULL,
country_continent varchar NOT NULL
);

#Then I inserted the Instagram data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

#First I determined the most popular profession/activity of the Instagram account owners
SELECT
profession_activity,
count(profession_activity) as popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Instagramdata
GROUP BY  profession_activity
ORDER BY popularity desc;

#Second, I inquired how many of the instagram accounts where owned by actors
SELECT
profession_activity,
count(profession_activity) as popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Instagramdata
WHERE profession_activity LIKE '%act%'
GROUP BY  profession_activity
ORDER BY popularity desc

#Lastly, I dermined the top 3 countries where the Instagram account owners reside
SELECT 
country_continent,
count(country_continent)
FROM
BIT_DB.Instagramdata
GROUP BY 
country_continent
ORDER BY 
country_continent desc
LIMIT 3;
